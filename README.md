# Welcom to my Lab 7 Sketch Repository!
 
By: Abbie Davidson

In this lab, I learned the basics of Git software. I learned how to use it to modify code when I am working on a project with a group.

Using Git, GitHb, and GitHub Desktop is helpful for tracking changes and allowing collaborators to work on a coding project simultaneously. Git functions as a control center, GitHub is where code can be reviewed and changed, and GitHub Desktop allows you to update work on GitHub and sync repositories. Overall, the system is a simple and efficient way to manage and work on projects.
